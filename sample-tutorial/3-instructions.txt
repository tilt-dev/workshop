Tilt supports per-resource buttons that can execute a local command for common tasks.
For example, a button could run a lint/format tool or reset a development DB to a clean state.

A button was just added to the 'my-app' resource with the text 'Click me!'.

Find it and click it, then return here.
(Don't worry - it won't actually run any code when clicked!)
